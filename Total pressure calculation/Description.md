Given the molecular mass of two molecules M1 and M2, their masses present m1 and m2 in a vessel of volume V at a specific temperature T, find the total pressure P<sub>total</sub> exerted by the molecules. Formula to calculate the pressure is:
> P<sub>total</sub> = ((m1/M1 + m2/M2)RT)/V
## Input
#### Six values:
- M1,M2: molar masses of both gases, in grams (g)
- m1,m2: present mass of both gases, in g/mol
- V: volume of the vessel, in dm<sup>3</sup>
- T: temperature, in Â°C

## Output
One value: P<sub>total</sub> in units of atm
